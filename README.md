# Book-a-table---nodejs
This project focuses on building book a table alexa skill which will allow people to book a table in their favourite restaurant.
In order to run this skill, you need to have the aws account. Put this code in aws console and go to aws developer account, create a new skill and add the address of console in end points section.
Here, I am using node js and I have given sample restaurants. This skill gives the information about those when user asks alexa.
